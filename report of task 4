# Firewall Configuration Report

## 1. Opening Windows Firewall Configuration Tool
- Accessed Windows Firewall by:
  - Opening Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall
  - Or using `wf.msc` command in Run dialog (Win+R)

## 2. Listing Current Firewall Rules
- Viewed current rules by:
  - Clicking "Advanced settings" in left pane
  - Navigated to "Inbound Rules" and "Outbound Rules" sections
  - Current rules displayed with name, profile, enabled status, and action

## 3. Adding a Block Rule for Specific Port
- Blocked inbound traffic on port 8080 (example port):
  1. In Advanced Settings, right-clicked "Inbound Rules"
  2. Selected "New Rule"
  3. Chose "Port" rule type
  4. Selected "TCP" and entered "8080" in specific ports
  5. Chose "Block the connection"
  6. Applied to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public)
  7. Named rule "Block_TCP_8080_Inbound"

## 4. Testing the Block Rule
- Tested the rule by:
  - Setting up a test web server on port 8080 (using Python: `python -m http.server 8080`)
  - Attempted to access from another machine using `telnet [IP] 8080`
  - Connection failed as expected
  - Verified in Windows Firewall logs that connection was blocked

## 6. Removing the Test Block Rule
- Removed the rule by:
  - Locating "Block_TCP_8080_Inbound" in Inbound Rules list
  - Right-clicking and selecting "Delete"
  - Confirmed deletion
  - Tested connection again - now successful

## 7. Documentation of Steps

## 8. Firewall Traffic Filtering Summary
A firewall filters network traffic by:
- Examining each packet's characteristics (source/destination IP, port, protocol)
- Comparing against defined rules (allow/block/ask)
- Making decisions based on rule order (first match applies)
- Stateful firewalls track connection state for smarter filtering
- Can filter inbound (to your system) and outbound (from your system) traffic
- Uses predefined security profiles (Public/Private/Domain) for different environments

The firewall acts as a gatekeeper, preventing unauthorized access while permitting legitimate communication according to configured rules.
